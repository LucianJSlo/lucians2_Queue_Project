    "This queue takes single individuals that arrive in a uniform rate, 0-5, and groups them up into teams of 5. Can we estimate the mean wait time in this queue? We know that when the 5th person joins the queue, the other 4 waiting are finally processed, and the 5th person waits no more time. How long does the first person wait? The second? Thrid? Fourth? Working backwards, the 4th person is expected to wait 2.5 seconds until the 5th person arrives, since $E[U] = (b-a)/2$. The third person expects to wait 5 seconds, the second, 7.5, and the first, 10. If we add these values up and divide by 5, we get 5. Lets see if Monte Carlo Simulations agree with us."

    "As shown in the code above, a Monte Carlo Simulation was able to match what we calculated as a mean wait time. The next steps would be to try to apply this to some of our other queues. The easiest to do this with, in my opinion, would be with match queues. We know that for each party waiting in the queue, there exists a complement out there that will process them immediately once they arrive. For uniform distributions, it would be easy to work out the expected value between a party arriving and its complement but I unfortunalty didn't get around to finding that out for myself."
