    "We did a lot of comparisons when it came to this topic. Not only did we compare \"Match\" Queues and \"Fill\" Queues, but we also compared their performance on a uniform/poisson distribution, we calculated wait times by party/individual, we compared each queue's mean/median wait time, and we saw how many people in our queue were processed. With all this information, let's pit the two against each other and find out who comes out on top"

All that's left is to determine which distribution matches the real world: do most people play by themselves, with a few dedicated duos/trios? Or is the player party size pool more equally spread out? Spoiler alert, most people play by themselves, especially since it could be more difficult getting a friend or 2 or 3 to play with you at the same time as well. \n",
