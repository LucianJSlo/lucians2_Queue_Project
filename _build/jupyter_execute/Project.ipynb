    "Imagine this: you wrap up your last final exam for the semester and you're ready to play the video game you've been wanting to play for a while. You sit down at your computer, start the game, join a lobby, and... wait. And then wait some more. At this point, you start getting frustrated; how long are you going to have to keep waiting for this game to start? That's what this research project hopes to answer!\n",

    "Each day, millions of people across the globe boot up their computers or consoles and turn on their favorite team based strategy games, whether that be Counter Strike, League of Legends, or Marvel Rivals. With that amount of players each day, it's important for video game developers to streamline the matchmaking process so that pleyers spend less time waiting around, and more time enjoying the action. In addition to lowering wait times, developers have to find the most optimal way to group players so that everyone gets a chance to play.\n",
